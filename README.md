# Spam-n-Ham-Detection

This is a College assignment of email classification and for this purpose here we have used Enron spam dataset which contains almost 4-5k of emails containing both 'ham'(not spam) and 'spam' emails. The idea is given an email you’ve never seen before, determine whether or not that email is Spam or not (aka Ham).
